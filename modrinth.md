Ever played on a multiplayer server, built near other players and when returning from the Nether, surprisingly found yourself in another player's base? It's because of the 8:1 block ratio between the Nether and the Overworld. It's really weird though that you enter a portal in the overworld, and then when going back through where you came, come out of a different portal in the overworld. This mod fixes that issue.

It keeps track of what portals a player went through in order to ensure correct destinations when the player is going back through the same portals. The 1:8 ratio remains, portals just get smarter and remember where you came from.

## Features

- As long as players use the same portal to return to the overworld, they will end up where they came from
- Only needs to be installed on the server (but works in singleplayer as well)
